tensor to javascript or j to use datasync
in the minimize, is there any variable, it will adjust it

cnn scale down the images, it's a break through thought

kernel is feature, some are about lines, some are about color or grading, each feature is decided by a study. deep learning does not need feature
image become small, but remain the feature, and the feature is more apparent
poolize remain the bigest data which is the feature
convolution sampling then pooling

tf.sequential is standard neuronetwork

[28, 28, 1], 1 means monocolor

filter: feature
variance scaling is very similar to random, but is different, it's in the 3 standard variance of a normal distribution

pooling is not necessary, because convolution can reduce.



flatten is transfering 2d images to 1d pixels, so that can put into selection.
dense is selection, standard neuro networks, but not reduce pixels(cnn reduce pixels). remember the selection of video of the first class.

before flatten just reduce the image.

categoricalcrossentropy

await is another new thread, which is more easy to be read than cell way
await make everything is ok, so that everything is operatable
