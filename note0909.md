column = field
row = record
one to plurity
plurity to plurity use another form with new id
not equal <>
'' means title of the field, not the string of the value
like '%Restaurant%', %means everything
it's better not to use "not"
use () will be more clear, for example, select * from students where not score >= 60 and score <= 95, means where not (score >= 60 and score <= 95)
